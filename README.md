# Pregnancy-and-Cheese
An Android app to know if a particular cheese is safe for a woman and her baby during pregnancy.

If you are pregnant and you love cheese, you must know that not any cheese is safe for you and your baby. 

Probably you know that milk must be pasteurized, but the relationship between milk fat and moisture is also very important to choose a healthy cheese.

Pregnancy and Cheese is a simple Android app that allows you to know before buying a cheese, if it is safe for you and your baby during pregnancy. You only have to introduce the percentage of milk fat and moisture of the cheese and the app will tell you if this particular cheese is a good choice for you. Do not worry, you can find this information on the label of the cheese.

I released the app making it available at the official marketplace.

It is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rsain.pregnancycheese.

NOTE: Please, take into account that this app does not replace your doctor.
